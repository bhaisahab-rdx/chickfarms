# Fixing "FUNCTION_INVOCATION_FAILED" Errors on Vercel

This guide specifically addresses the `FUNCTION_INVOCATION_FAILED` error that can occur when deploying serverless functions to Vercel.

## Common Error Message

```
500: INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR
Code: FUNCTION_INVOCATION_FAILED
ID: bom1::ww2qn-xxxxxxxxxx-xxxxxxxx
```

## Step-by-Step Troubleshooting

### 1. Verify Your Function Code is Compatible with Serverless

Serverless functions on Vercel have some limitations:

- **Limited Execution Time**: Functions time out after 10 seconds by default
- **Memory Constraints**: Default is 1024MB
- **Cold Starts**: Functions may take longer on first execution
- **No Filesystem Access**: The filesystem is read-only (except for `/tmp`)

### 2. Test with Minimal API Endpoints First

We've created a minimal API endpoint at `/api/minimal.js` that should work under all circumstances. Test this first:

```
https://yourdomain.vercel.app/api/minimal
```

If this works, your basic Vercel configuration is correct. If not, the issue is likely with the Vercel platform itself.

### 3. Check Environment Variables

Use the diagnostics endpoint to verify environment variables are correctly set:

```
https://yourdomain.vercel.app/api/diagnostics
```

This will show which environment variables are available to your functions.

### 4. Database Connection Issues

Many `FUNCTION_INVOCATION_FAILED` errors are due to database connection problems:

1. **Connection String**: Verify your DATABASE_URL is correct
2. **IP Allowlist**: Check if your database (Supabase/PostgreSQL) requires IP allowlisting
3. **Connection Limits**: Serverless functions can quickly exhaust connection pools
4. **Connection Timeout**: Network latency between Vercel and your database might be high

### 5. Memory and Performance Optimization

We've already updated your `vercel.json` to include:

```json
"functions": {
  "api/*.js": {
    "memory": 1024,
    "maxDuration": 10
  }
}
```

This increases the available memory and execution time for your functions.

### 6. Apply Progressive Enhancement

1. Start with the simplest functioning endpoint
2. Add complexity gradually, testing after each addition
3. Isolate problematic code by testing parts independently

### 7. Check Logs in Vercel Dashboard

The Vercel dashboard provides detailed logs for each function invocation:

1. Go to your Vercel project dashboard
2. Click on "Functions" in the sidebar
3. Look for invocations with errors
4. Click on a specific invocation to see detailed logs

### 8. Special Considerations for Database Connections

For database-heavy applications:

1. **Use Connection Pooling**: Configure your database with connection pooling
2. **Implement Retries**: Add retry logic for failed database connections
3. **Add Timeouts**: Set explicit timeouts on database operations
4. **Consider Serverless Database**: Use a database designed for serverless (like Neon or PlanetScale)

### 9. Testing the Fix

1. Test the `/vercel-test.html` page to verify static content works
2. Test basic API endpoints (`/api/minimal`, `/api/health`, `/api/diagnostics`)
3. Test the main application functionality

## If Nothing Works

If you've tried all of the above and still encounter errors:

1. Consider deploying without the database temporarily to verify the rest of the app works
2. Try a different region in Vercel
3. Contact Vercel support with your function ID and error details
4. Consider a different deployment platform like Netlify or Railway that handles Node.js APIs differently
