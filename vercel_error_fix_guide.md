# ChickFarms Vercel Deployment Error Fix Guide

This guide provides solutions to common Vercel deployment issues with the ChickFarms application.

## Common 404 Errors

If you're encountering 404 errors on your deployed Vercel application, try these troubleshooting steps:

### 1. Verify API Routes

The most common issue is API requests failing with 404 errors. Check:

- Visit `https://chiket.vercel.app/health.html` to verify the deployment is running
- Open your browser dev tools and check the Network tab for failing API requests
- Confirm the request URLs match your expected endpoints

### 2. CORS Issues

If browser console shows CORS errors:

- Verify the allowed origins in `api/index.js` include your deployed domain
- Ensure the proper headers are being set in the API responses
- Try testing with a tool like Postman to bypass browser CORS restrictions

### 3. Path Resolution Problems

Vercel's serverless functions handle paths differently:

- Make sure API routes are properly handled by the `/api/app.js` function
- Check that frontend routes have a proper fallback to the main HTML file
- Confirm that `/api/*` routes are correctly mapped in `vercel.json`

### 4. Environment Variables

Missing environment variables can cause silent failures:

- Verify all required environment variables are set in the Vercel dashboard
- Check that `DATABASE_URL`, `SESSION_SECRET`, and other critical variables are defined
- Ensure `VERCEL_URL` is properly available and used in the CORS configuration

### 5. Database Connection Issues

Database connectivity problems can cause API failures:

- Check that the database is accessible from Vercel's IP range
- Verify the database credentials are correct in the environment variables
- Test the database connection from a local environment pointing to production

### 6. Deployment Cache Issues

Sometimes deployment caching can cause problems:

- Try a "Clear Cache and Deploy" option in the Vercel dashboard
- Force a new deployment with a trivial change
- Delete and recreate the project in Vercel as a last resort

## Manual Verification Steps

To manually verify your API is working:

1. Run `curl https://chiket.vercel.app/api/status` and check for a 200 response
2. Visit `https://chiket.vercel.app/health.html` in your browser
3. Check the Vercel deployment logs for any error messages
4. Use the Vercel CLI to pull environment variables and verify they're correct

## Technical Changes Made

The following technical changes have been implemented to fix deployment issues:

1. Changed the API handler to use a more compatible approach with Vercel
2. Updated CORS configuration to handle both development and production environments
3. Modified session cookie settings for secure cross-domain usage
4. Added comprehensive error logging to identify deployment issues
5. Updated the build process to correctly bundle both frontend and API files

If you continue experiencing issues after trying these solutions, please collect detailed error logs from both the browser console and Vercel deployment logs for further debugging.
