Objective:

Daily Rewards & Streak System – Players earn increasing daily rewards for logging in consistently.
🔮 Mystery Boxes & Loot Crates System
📦 How It Works:

Players can purchase mystery boxes with USDT to receive random in-game rewards.
Each mystery box contains a random item with different probabilities.
Higher-tier boxes provide better rewards but cost more.
📊 Mystery Box Pricing & Reward Probability:

Box Type	Price (USDT)	Possible Rewards	Probability Distribution
Basic Box	$10	10-50 Wheat, 5-20 Water, 1-5 Eggs	Common (70%), Rare (30%)
Silver Box	$25	50-150 Wheat, 20-50 Water, 5-15 Eggs, Baby Chicken	Common (50%), Rare (40%), Epic (10%)
Golden Box	$50	150-300 Wheat, 50-100 Water, 15-30 Eggs, Regular Chicken, +5% USDT Bonus	Common (30%), Rare (40%), Epic (20%), Legendary (10%)
Diamond Box	$100	300-500 Wheat, 100-200 Water, 30-50 Eggs, Golden Chicken, +10% USDT Bonus	Rare (30%), Epic (50%), Legendary (20%)
🛠 Logic for Mystery Boxes:

The system uses randomized probability generation to determine the reward.
Higher-tier boxes offer better rewards, increasing potential ROI.
This encourages investment and engagement while maintaining game balance.
🎁 Daily Rewards & Streak System
📅 How It Works:

Players receive daily login rewards that increase with consecutive logins.
A streak resets if a player misses a day.
Rewards range from free wheat and water to bonus USDT and mystery boxes.
📊 Daily Rewards Breakdown:

Day	Reward
Day 1	10 Wheat + 5 Water
Day 2	15 Wheat + 10 Water
Day 3	1 Free Basic Mystery Box
Day 4	30 Wheat + 20 Water
Day 5	5 Bonus Eggs + 50 Wheat
Day 6	1 Free Silver Mystery Box
Day 7	0.5 USDT Bonus + 1 Free Golden Box
💡 Streak Logic:

If a player misses a day, their streak resets to Day 1.
Higher streaks = better rewards, motivating daily engagement.
Players who maintain streaks for months can receive special bonuses.
