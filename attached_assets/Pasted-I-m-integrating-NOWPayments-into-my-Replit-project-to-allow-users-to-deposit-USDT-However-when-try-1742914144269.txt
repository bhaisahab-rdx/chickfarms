I'm integrating NOWPayments into my Replit project to allow users to deposit USDT. However, when trying to create an invoice, I receive the following error:

Request failed with status code 400
üîç What I Need You to Do:
1Ô∏è‚É£ Debug & Fix the NOWPayments API Request:

Ensure the API request matches NOWPayments' correct format.

Validate that price_currency, pay_currency, and price_amount are correct.

Ensure headers contain a valid API key.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Check API Key & Authentication:

Verify that the API key is being sent correctly.

If missing, add "x-api-key": "MY_NOWPAYMENTS_API_KEY" in the headers.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Ensure Webhook & URLs Are Correct:

The ipn_callback_url should be publicly accessible (not localhost).

Confirm success_url and cancel_url are set correctly.

4Ô∏è‚É£ Print & Log Full API Response:

Add console.log(response.data) after making the request to see detailed errors.

5Ô∏è‚É£ Test the API Using a Manual Request:

Provide me with a cURL command I can use to manually test if the request works.

üìå Here is My Current API Request Code:

const axios = require("axios");

async function createInvoice() {
    const requestData = {
        price_amount: 90,
        price_currency: "usdt",
        pay_currency: "trx",
        order_id: "user_12345",
        order_description: "Deposit for ChickFarms",
        ipn_callback_url: "https://your-replit-backend-url.com/webhook",
        success_url: "https://your-game-url.com/success",
        cancel_url: "https://your-game-url.com/cancel"
    };

    try {
        const response = await axios.post("https://api.nowpayments.io/v1/invoice", requestData, {
            headers: {
                "x-api-key": "MY_NOWPAYMENTS_API_KEY",
                "Content-Type": "application/json"
            }
        });

        console.log(response.data);
        return response.data;
    } catch (error) {
        console.error("Error creating invoice:", error.response?.data || error.message);
    }
}

createInvoice();
üí° Expected Outcome:

The NOWPayments invoice should be successfully created.

A valid payment link & QR code should be returned.

Webhook should be triggered when payment is completed.

üöÄ Fix this and ensure the NOWPayments integration works correctly.
