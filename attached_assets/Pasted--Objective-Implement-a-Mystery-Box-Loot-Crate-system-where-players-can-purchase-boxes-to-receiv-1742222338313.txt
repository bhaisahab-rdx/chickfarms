💡 Objective: Implement a Mystery Box & Loot Crate system where players can purchase boxes to receive randomized rewards such as eggs, rare chickens, or USDT. Include an opening animation for an engaging experience.

🔹 Mystery Box Mechanics & Pricing
Players can purchase different tiers of Mystery Boxes using USDT for a chance to win rewards. The higher the box tier, the better the rewards.

🎁 Mystery Box Type	💰 Price (USDT)	🎲 Possible Rewards
Basic Mystery Box	5 USDT	5-20 eggs
Advanced Mystery Box	10 USDT	10-50 eggs OR a free Baby Chicken (5% chance)
Legendary Mystery Box	25 USDT	50-200 eggs OR a Rare Chicken (10% chance) OR 5 USDT cashback (3% chance)
🔹 How It Works (Game Logic & Implementation)
1️⃣ Buying a Mystery Box
Players navigate to the Shop and select Mystery Boxes.
They can choose a box and pay with USDT.
After payment, the "Open Box" button appears.
2️⃣ Opening Animation & Randomized Rewards
A Loot Crate Opening Animation plays for 3-5 seconds.
Inside the animation:
Box shakes or glows before opening.
Random rewards appear in a spinning carousel effect.
A "Congratulations!" pop-up shows the reward.
The reward is automatically added to the player's inventory (eggs, chickens, or USDT).
3️⃣ Reward Probability System
Each box follows a weighted random reward distribution:

Basic Mystery Box (5 USDT)
50% chance → 5-10 eggs
40% chance → 11-15 eggs
10% chance → 16-20 eggs
Advanced Mystery Box (10 USDT)
40% chance → 10-20 eggs
35% chance → 21-35 eggs
20% chance → 36-50 eggs
5% chance → 1 Free Baby Chicken
Legendary Mystery Box (25 USDT)
35% chance → 50-100 eggs
30% chance → 101-150 eggs
22% chance → 151-200 eggs
10% chance → 1 Rare Chicken
3% chance → 5 USDT cashback
