If you want users to pay using USDT on Tron (TRC20), you need to specify USDT-TRC20 as the pay_currency in your NOWPayments API request.

âœ… Correct API Request for USDT (TRC20) Payments
Make sure your request follows this format:

json
Copy
Edit
{
  "price_amount": 90,
  "price_currency": "USDT",
  "pay_currency": "USDTTRC20",
  "ipn_callback_url": "https://your-website.com/ipn",
  "order_id": "ORDER1234",
  "order_description": "Purchase of Chickens"
}
ðŸ”¹ Fixing Common Issues
Ensure pay_currency is set to USDTTRC20, not just USDT.

Check if NOWPayments supports USDT-TRC20 by running:

bash
Copy
Edit
curl -X GET "https://api.nowpayments.io/v1/currencies" \
     -H "x-api-key: YOUR_NOWPAYMENTS_API_KEY"
Make sure ipn_callback_url is a valid URL (it should be HTTPS and publicly accessible).

Confirm that your NOWPayments account supports USDT-TRC20 transactions.

I want to integrate NOWPayments into my Replit project so users can pay using USDT on Tron (TRC20).
Currently, I get an error when creating a payment: "Can not get estimate from BTC to USDT."

Fix the NOWPayments integration by ensuring:
1. Users pay in **USDT on Tron (TRC20)**.
2. The API request correctly includes `pay_currency: "USDTTRC20"`.
3. The `ipn_callback_url` is correctly set.
4. The NOWPayments popup displays for users to complete payment.
5. Any unsupported conversion issues are handled properly.

Check for errors and make it work smoothly.
